# [Zen](https://opencode.ai/zen): stealth model gateway
> Access reliable optimized models for coding agents
a handpicked set of AI models that OpenCode has tested and benchmarked specifically for coding agents.
- No need to worry about inconsistent performance and quality across providers, use validated models that work.
- yet another openrouter
  - you can use Zen with any agent
- sovereignty: All Zen models are hosted in the US
  - exception: Grok Code Fast 1, GLM 4.7, MiniMax M2.1, Big Pickle: During free period, collected data may be used to improve the model
  - exception: Requests are retained for 30 days in accordance with OpenAI’s Data Policies or Anthropic’s Data Policies.

Zen's Goal
- Benchmark the best models/providers for coding agents.
- Have access to the highest quality options and not downgrade performance or route to cheaper providers.
- Pass along any price drops by selling at cost; so the only markup is to cover our processing fees.
- Have no lock-in by allowing you to use it with any other coding agent. And always let you use any other provider with OpenCode as well.
